Opportunistic routing provided the message forwarding scheme
in various scenarios, including the wild-fields

The main contributions are as follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item {we designed the two-tier probability model
to profile the probability density of the future contact events
in the message lifetime.}
\item {we employed the inter-day probability based on the poisson process
the intra-day probability pattern based on gaussian mixture model
to measure the probability of sequential events.
Multiple potential routes of message forwarding
are utilized to support the routing decision.}
\item {we exploit the local differential privacy 
to obscure the pattern of contact events.}
\item {we evaluate the proposed scheme with the benchmarks,
such as S\&W, Epidemic, Prophet,
in terms of the routing performance under various settings
with the bike sharing trace.}
\end{itemize}
