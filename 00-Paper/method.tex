\subsection{Differential Privacy Preserving of Pattern}
The differential privacy, as a provably privacy preserving method,
is employed to obscure the intra-day probability pattern of contacts.
Take $i \rightarrow j$ as an example,
${p(x)}_{1 \le x \le 24}$ will represent the contact pattern.
The sensitivity can be calculated as
\begin{equation}
\nonumber
\Delta f = max_{\{p_{1}(x)\},\{p_{2}(x)\}} \sum_{x=1}^{24} || p_{1}(x) - p_{2}(x) ||_{1} = 2.
\end{equation}
For example, ....

The published probability density $\{p^{\prime}(x)\}_{1 \le x \le 24}$ is obscured
according to $p^{\prime}(x) = p(x) + Lap(\frac{\Delta f}{\varepsilon})$.
$\varepsilon$ is the specified privacy parameter to control the magnitude of privacy preserving.
