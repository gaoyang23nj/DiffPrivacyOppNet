Opportunistic Networks (OppNets) have been attracting research attentions in these years.
The message disseminations among stations in the bike sharing system (BSS) 
can be conducted through the bike trips.
However, predicting the future bike trips and exploiting the predicted bike trips in the message forwarding
is still required to be research. 
Moreover, the privacy exposure caused by the information exchange also needs to be mitigated.
In order to predict the bike trip accurately,
we investigate the temporal pattern of the bike trips, i.e. the inter-day pattern and the intra-day pattern, 
and design the two-tier probability model based on the history bike trip for each pair of stations.
Then the Opportunistic Routing based on the Two-tier Probability Model (RTPM) is proposed
to improve the routing performance and protect the privacy of the routing metric.
The simulation performance verifies the effectiveness of our proposed method.
